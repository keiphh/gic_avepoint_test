# Introduction

In this repository, you can find the given questions and solutions.

There were two tests given in the following files:
1. *SQL_Test.pdf*
2. *auto_driving.md* 

## SQL_Test.pdf
For this SQL test, the solution was provided in a single file named *sql_test.sql*. The solutions for all 5 questions are in it. The development was done in a SQL Server database, so a recommended software to use would be Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

Use the CREATE TABLE script (*create_employee_table.sql*) to create the table in any database. The default schema will be named dbo.

Use the INSERT INTO script (*insert_employee_table.sql*) to insert the records into the created table.

Run the *sql_test.sql* script to get the result to the solutions.

## auto_driving.md
For this python test, the solution was provided in a python file named *auto_driving.py*.

The solution was tested locally for Scenario 1 and 2.

### Running the code (The code was developed using Python 3.12.6)
* Via command line: simply run the file using the python or python3 command followed by the file name.
* Via IDE: open the file and click run.

### Assumptions
Only valid inputs are provided by the user.
